# Task 2 – Tic Tac Toe AI  
CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship

This project is a simple implementation of the classic *Tic Tac Toe* game in Python  
with an AI opponent using the **Minimax algorithm**.  
The system allows a user to play against a computer that always makes the optimal move.

All game history is saved automatically in `game_logs.jsonl` as proof of execution.
