# Task 3 – Movie Recommendation System  
CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship

This is a content-based Movie Recommendation System built using Python.  
The system uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to find movies that are 
similar to the input movie title.  
All recommendation results are saved automatically in `rec_results.json` as proof of execution.
